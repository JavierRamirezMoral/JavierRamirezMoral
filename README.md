👋🏻 Welcome!

👨🏻‍💻 My name is Javier, and I'm passionate about the world of computing, particularly in the Cloud sector.

☁️ Currently, I am pursuing a Master's degree in MultiCloud Systems Administration with Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services, and Google Cloud Platform. I am also expanding my expertise with DevOps tools such as Terraform, Kubernetes, and Docker, among others.

🚀 Based on my interests and aspirations, my professional objective is to specialize and learn technologies including:
• Terraform for infrastructure as code.
• Docker and Kubernetes for containerization.
• Solutions in SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS services.
• CI/CD DevOps Jenkins GitHub.

👥 I am involved as a Tech Rider collaborating with Tajamar Tech to carry out various presentations, event organization, and projects, among other initiatives. I am also a part of Cloud Sculptor, an association with some classmates from the Master's program to execute diverse projects with different technologies, linking them together to achieve comprehensive and original solutions.

💡I am proactive, always seeking continuous learning to explore various topics, embracing challenges, and devising future plans. I thrive on achieving challenging goals within teams of individuals who share my passions, fostering an environment of trust, motivation, and mutual support.

🔎 If you are seeking someone with the ability to adapt to different challenges and projects, with an open-minded and results-driven mindset, offering a distinct value and a clear, direct approach, feel free to connect with me.
